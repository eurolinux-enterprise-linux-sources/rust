# When uploading crates to the registry Cargo will automatically
# "normalize" Cargo.toml files for maximal compatibility
# with all versions of Cargo and also rewrite `path` dependencies
# to registry (e.g. crates.io) dependencies

# If you believe there's an error in this file please file an
# issue against the rust-lang/cargo repository. If you're
# editing this file be aware that the upstream Cargo.toml
# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable)
